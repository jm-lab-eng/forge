    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <div class="case-block">
        <h2>📌 Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
        DRACO is an in-service robotic system developed for cleaning crude oil storage tanks without requiring shutdown. 
        The system was designed to operate in ATEX Zone-0 hazardous environments, handling high-viscosity sludge while ensuring 
        safety, reliability, and operational efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
        As Project Lead and Senior Mechanical Design Engineer, I led the complete lifecycle from concept development to 
        prototype validation and field deployment.
        </p>

    <!-- PROBLEM -->
    <div class="case-block">
        <h2>⚠️ Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
        Conventional tank cleaning requires shutdown and manual entry, leading to high operational losses and safety risks. 
        The challenge was to develop a system capable of operating inside live tanks with viscous sludge and explosive atmosphere.

    <div class="case-block">
        <h2>🛢️ Sludge Removal System</h2>
        <p>
        A custom hydraulic piston pump was developed to handle high-viscosity sludge under submerged conditions. 
        The system ensured reliable suction and discharge using synchronized hydraulic actuation.

    <div class="case-block">
        <h2>🌀 Propulsion System</h2>
        <p>
        A multi-propeller configuration was developed for manoeuvrability within the tank. The design was optimized 
        for thrust generation in viscous fluid environments and validated through both simulation and physical testing.
