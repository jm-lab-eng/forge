    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
    Mechanical Design Engineer with over 4 years of experience developing
    real-world, field-deployed systems in robotics and industrial environments.
    Focused on translating engineering concepts into practical, reliable,
    and manufacturable solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
    Experienced in end-to-end product development, including concept design,
    mechanical architecture, system integration, structural optimisation,
    and validation in demanding operating conditions. Strong emphasis on
    performance, safety, and design for manufacturability (DFMA).
    </p>

    <p>
    Skilled in solving engineering challenges involving constrained spaces,
    harsh environments, and safety-critical requirements. Comfortable working
    across multidisciplinary systems with electro-mechanical integration.
    </p>

    <p>
    Proven ability to collaborate with cross-functional teams and drive
    engineering activities across design, fabrication, and testing phases.
    Committed to delivering robust systems that perform reliably in real-world
    applications.
